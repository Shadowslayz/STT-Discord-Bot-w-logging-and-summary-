# Discord STT + Summarizer Bot

This project is a Discord bot built with [Py-Cord](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord) that can join voice channels, record conversations, transcribe speech to text using [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/), and save transcripts per guild. It also integrates with OpenAI GPT to summarize conversations into meeting notes, including key topics, decisions, action items, and notable quotes. The bot is designed for **one active server at a time**, preventing conflicts across multiple guilds, with per-guild configuration for text channels, voice channels, and nickname usage. Commands are implemented with **slash commands** for easy use.
